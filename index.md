# What's your tech background?
I have years of experience as a Linux systems administrator for RHEL. I have been involved in setting up on-prem infrastructure on bare metal servers as well as recently doing most of my work in AWS. 

Outside of work, I like games and puzzles. From time to time I have written applications interacting with these. 

# What are you working on now?
I am currently working on two main projects:
1.  A tool to modify Catherine Classic levels. Right now, eveything has to be done in a hex editor. It would be ideal to add some sort of 3D gui. 
1. A webapp for modern fgc analytic data. There are numerous sites like [braacket](https://braacket.com/) where you can import tournaments and keep track of who won/loss and calculate ELO. This is all you really need in a traditional game like chess, but modern fighting games have more dynamic variables like stage and character selection that would also be nifty to track.
1. Modding Dynasty Warriors 3 versus mode for a more balanced experience.

Less technical projects include:
1. Continue to grow/refine [Climb Cancel](https://twitter.com/climbcancel) as an international event for niche videogames.
1. Finish this murder mystery I've been writing on and off.
1. Get back into Go (the game, not the language!) I have had a long term goal to reach a rank of 1 dan. Last I played I was around the 10 kyuu rank, so I have a few levels to go.
1. Basic woodworking skills.

# What are some of your past projects?
