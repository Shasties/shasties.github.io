# What's your tech background?
I have years of experience as a Linux systems administrator for RHEL. I have been involved in setting up on-prem infrastructure on bare metal servers as well as recently doing most of my work in AWS. 

Outside of work, I like games and puzzles. From time to time I have written applications interacting with these. 

# What are you passionate about?
I like automating things. Creating pipelines, setting up artifact repositories, developing test suites, etc. I would like to do more work with Machine Learning to create AGI for videogames. 

# What are you working on now?
I am currently working on two main projects:
1.  A tool to modify Catherine Classic levels. Right now, eveything has to be done in a hex editor. Would be ideal to add some sort of 3D gui. 
1. A webapp for modern fgc analytic data. There are numerous sites like [braacket](https://braacket.com/) where you can import tournaments and keep track of who won/loss and calculate ELO. This is all you really need in a traditional game like chess, but modern fighting games have more dynamic variables like stage and character selection that would also be nifty to track.

Less technical projects include:
1. A murder mystery visual novel (this may turn into a traditional novel)
1. A game about Paul Bunyan in RPG Maker

# What are some of your past projects?
* [A python app to quickly swap characters and textures in Catherine Classic](https://github.com/Shasties/catherine_character_mods)
* [A python app to gather information about all members of a Spartan Company in Halo 5](https://github.com/Shasties/spartan-company-tracker-cli)
* [A discord bot written in python to add inspirational quotes to images from Nostalgia Critic's _The Wall_](https://github.com/Shasties/ncbot)

# Where can I follow you?
I have a private [twitter](https://twitter.com/_shasties_). You can also request to message Shas#6842 on Discord.
